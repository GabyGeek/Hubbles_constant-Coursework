# Hubbles_constant-Coursework
Completed in my first term at university the code is takes in 30 observations of the redshifted Hα line from different galaxies and the distance to each galaxy, and calculates a value for Hubble’s constant. The output of the code is a velocity-distance plot for each galaxy in the dataset and the value of Hubble's constant drawn from fitting the plot along with the uncertainty on the constant.
